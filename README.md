# Network Intrustion Detection System Using Learning Based Approaches

## Abstract

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a critical role in protecting computer networks from various security threats and attacks. As the complexity and frequency of network attacks continue to evolve, there is a growing need for advanced analytics techniques to enhance the detection and response capabilities of NIDS. This research focuses on the development and utilization of analytics methods for network intrusion detection systems. The goal is to leverage these techniques to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of NIDS in identifying and mitigating security breaches. The research begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of network intrusion detection, including the different types of attacks and the challenges associated with their detection. Various types of NIDS, including signature-based and anomaly-based systems, are discussed, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Overall, this research aims to advance the field of network intrusion detection by leveraging analytics techniques to enhance the capabilities of NIDS. The proposed methods offer the potential to improve the accuracy of attack detection, reduce false positives, enable efficient processing of big data, and facilitate automated incident response. The findings of this research will contribute to the development of more robust and effective network security systems in the face of ever-evolving cyber threats.
